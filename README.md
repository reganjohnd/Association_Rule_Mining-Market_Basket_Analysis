## Market basket analysis

### Dataset
#### This market basket analysis is based on transactional data from a grocery store.

### Objective
#### The grocery store would like to spend additional capital on marketing and promotions. However, they have no idea where to start.<br/>They would like to know which products to advertise and what to expect when these products are sold, and which products to offer discounts and promotions on.

### Methodology
#### I perform pre-processing on the transactional data to prepare it for the implementation of the apriori algorithm. This provides an output of ferquent itemsets with their associated support, confidence and lift values.<br/><br/>I use scatterplot and bubble visualisations to understand the interaction between these variables.<br/>I am able to narrow down the support, confidence and lift values of interest based on the bubble chart which leaves us with a reasonable list of itemsets
